    "summary": "Throughout my 5-year-plus career as a software / hardware engineer, I have learned a lot of different technologies. At my last job, I worked on industrial SCADA systems (front-end apps for controlling industrial machines). One of the clients required remote control of systems. For this project, I built an app that runs in a web browser. Seeing how there is a lot of demand for web apps, this has sparked my interest in web development. I spent last year learning on my own and also did three months internship with mentor at Ingsoftware. Below you'll find projects I've completed that showcase my skills as a front-end developer.",
